## Blockchain Architecture

### Consensus Mechanism

Devil's Coin utilizes a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm with the following features:

#### Validator Selection
- **Stake-Weighted Random Selection**: Validators are chosen based on stake amount and randomization
- **Minimum Stake Requirement**: 10,000 DVC to become a validator
- **Slashing Conditions**: Validators lose stake for malicious behavior
- **Reward Distribution**: Block rewards distributed proportionally to stake

#### Block Production
1. **Slot Assignment**: Each 13-second slot is assigned to a validator
2. **Block Proposal**: Selected validator proposes a new block
3. **Attestation**: Other validators attest to block validity
4. **Finalization**: Blocks finalized after 3 confirmations

### Network Topology

## Tokenomics

### Token Distribution

| Allocation | Amount | Percentage | Vesting |
|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Presale** | 13,333,333 DVC | 20% | Immediate |
| **Staking Rewards** | 20,000,000 DVC | 30% | 5 years |
| **Liquidity Pool** | 26,666,667 DVC | 40% | Immediate |
| **Team & Development** | 6,666,666 DVC | 10% | 2 years |

### Supply Schedule

```
Year 1: 66,666,666 DVC (Genesis)
Year 2: ~63,000,000 DVC (5% burn)
Year 3: ~59,850,000 DVC (5% burn)
Year 4: ~56,857,500 DVC (5% burn)
Year 5: ~54,014,625 DVC (5% burn)
```

### Deflationary Mechanisms

1. **Transaction Fees**: 50% of fees burned, 50% to validators
2. **Staking Penalties**: Slashed tokens permanently removed
3. **Governance Burns**: Community-voted token burns
4. **DeFi Integration**: Protocol fees contribute to burns

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

#### DevilsCoin Token Contract
```solidity
contract DevilsCoin is ERC20, Ownable, Pausable {
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_SUPPLY = 66_666_666 * 10**18;
    uint256 public stakingAPY = 666; // 6.66% in basis points
    
    mapping(address => StakingInfo) public stakingData;
    
    struct StakingInfo {
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 timestamp;
        uint256 rewards;
    }
}
```

#### Staking Contract
- **Lock Period**: 30 days minimum
- **Reward Rate**: 6.66% APY
- **Compound Option**: Auto-compound rewards
- **Early Withdrawal**: Penalty applies

#### Governance Contract
- **Proposal Threshold**: 1% of total supply
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Quorum**: 10% of circulating supply
- **Execution Delay**: 24 hours

### Security Features

- **Multi-signature Wallets**: Critical functions require multiple signatures
- **Time Locks**: Important changes have mandatory delays
- **Pausable Contracts**: Emergency stop functionality

---

## Staking Mechanism

### Staking Process

1. **Token Lock**: Users lock DVC tokens for minimum 30 days
2. **Reward Calculation**: APY calculated based on lock duration
3. **Compound Options**: Users can auto-compound or claim rewards
4. **Unstaking**: Cooldown period before tokens are released

### Reward Formula

```
Daily Reward = (Staked Amount × APY) / 365
Compound Interest = Principal × (1 + Daily Rate)^Days
```

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | Minimum Stake | APY Bonus | Lock Period |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Bronze** | 1,000 DVC | 0% | 30 days |
| **Silver** | 5,000 DVC | +0.5% | 60 days |
| **Gold** | 10,000 DVC | +1% | 90 days |
| **Diamond** | 50,000 DVC | +2% | 180 days |
